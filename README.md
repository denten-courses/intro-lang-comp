When in doubt, cite! Plagiarism is insulting to your fellow students, your
instructors, and to the research community at large. It wastes my time and
yours, and is, ultimately, not worth the risk. Consult Columbia’s guidelines
at <http://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/integrity> or ask me for help
early in the writing process.
